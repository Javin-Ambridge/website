				 Computer Science has been my passion ever since my early days as a unknowledgeable high school student stumbling into the treacherous yet beautiful world of computer science languages. Since then I have garnered a wide range of applicable skills, from university courses to side projects, I have never faltered in my journey to become a hard working knowledgeable programming employee.<br><br>

				 Much like the majority of programmers I am a combination of being self taught and being educated through the university curriculum. I have delved into many different parts of the computer science industry, from my early experience developing games with the Java library and then expanding that knowledge to work with the LWJGL Java game libraries. I have had my fair experience making heavy algorithmic programs, ranging from a perfect 2 dimensional physics simulator that updates in current time the velocity and angle of up to two balls, in a frictionless environment. I have also made a sudoku solver in two languages, one for a side project in Java, and one as a final assignment for my Waterloo class, which was coded in Scheme (Dr. Racket). All of these projects are available in my past projects page (just click the previous work tab!) <br><br>

				 I have had a wide range of previous job experience, I was an English tutor for my entire 4 year high school term. Through this tutoring experience I have garnered a good few attributes, it gave me the ability to act quickly and solve various problems with abstract thinking, I had to create a fundamental teaching schedule for each of my students. To do so I had to identify what each students strengths and weaknesses were and how to best tutor them to maximise efficiency and results. As well as my experience as a tutor I have worked for a total of 3 years with the City of Toronto, as a Lifeguard and a Wading Pool Attendant. These experiences, as well as others that are outlined on my resume give me the necessary skills and mindsets to work productively and correctly in the technology sector.
				 <br><br>

				 I am currently looking for a part-time programming job that can challenge me everyday to better myself and increase my knowledge of computer science practices. I hope to learn and flourish in a position which challenges me in every way, while still having the opportunity to grow inside the business.
