			Computer Science has always been my passion. Ever since my grade 11 computer science class I knew that this was
			the field of study I wanted to pursue. I have never faltered in my journey to become a hard
			working knowledgable programmer and have proactively acquired a
			wide variety of applicable skills learned through a combination of sources:
			attending university courses, side projects, self development (online courses),
			and co-op work terms.<br><br>

			I have delved into many different sectors of the computer science industry.
			Early on I developed games with the Java library and then expanded that knowledge
			to work with the LWJGL Java game libraries. I have created numerous heavy algorithmic
			programs, for example creating a perfect 2 dimensional physics simulator that updates
			in current time the velocity and angle of up to two balls.
			I have also programmed many projects for my previous employer, many which are still
			in use today, more information on these projects can be read on my Resume/Cover letter.
			Lastly I have also made a Sudoku solver in two languages, one for a side project in
			Java, and one as a final assignment for my Waterloo class, which was coded in Scheme
			(Dr. Racket). All of these projects are available in my past projects page
			(just click <a href="previousWork.html" style="text-decoration: underline">here</a>)<br><br>

			My prior job experiences all improved my interpersonal and communication skills
			which are key in being able to understand the investors goals and being able
			to work effectively in a team environment. As an English tutor during my 4 year high
			school term, I learned to think outside the box, communicate effectively, understand
			another perspective, act quickly and solve various problems with abstract thinking.
			Dealing effectively with short deadlines meant I had to create a fundamental teaching
			schedule for each of my students, quickly identify each student's strengths and
			weaknesses and how to best tutor them to maximize efficiency and results.
			In addition to being a tutor during the school year, I worked for a total
			of 3 summers with the City of Toronto, as a Lifeguard and a Wading Pool Attendant
			liaising with hundreds of clients with differing needs. These experiences, as
		  well as others that are outlined on my resume.<br><br>

			I am currently looking for a part-time programming job where my work makes a
			difference and benefits the organization and where I am challenged and can learn more.
